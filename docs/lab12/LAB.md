# üí° Lab 12 - Module boundaries

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 10-15 minutes

<br /><br />

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- **Understand how to assign scopes and type tags to your libraries**
- **How to specify boundaries around your tags and avoid circular dependencies in your repo**
- **How to use linting to trigger warnings or errors when you are not respecting these boundaries**
  <br /><br /><br />

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

1. Open the `project.json` files for each project and **finish tagging the apps** accordingly:

   ```
     // apps/store/project.json
     {
       "projectType": "application",
       "root": "apps/store",
       "sourceRoot": "apps/store/src",
       "prefix": "bg-hoard",
       "targets": { ... },
       "tags": ["scope:store", "type:app"]
     }
   ```

   <br /><br />

2. Open the root `.eslintrc.json`, find the `"@nrwl/nx/enforce-module-boundaries"` rule and **set the `depConstraints`**:

   ```
   "depConstraints": [
       {
           "sourceTag": "scope:store",
           "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": ["scope:store", "scope:shared"]
       },
       .... <-- finish adding constraints for the tags we defined in the previous step
   ]
   ```

   <br /><br />

3. **Run `nx run-many --target=lint --all --parallel`**

   üí° `nx run-many` allows you run a specific target against a specific set of projects
   via the `--projects=[..]` option. However, you can also pass it the `--all` option
   to run that target against all projects in your workspace.

   üí° `--parallel` launches all the `lint` processes in parallel
   <br /><br />

4. We talked about how importing a **Feature** lib should not be allowed from a
   **UI** lib. Let's **test our lint rules** by doing just that: - In `libs/store/ui-shared/src/lib/store-ui-shared.module.ts` - Try to `import { StoreFeatureGameDetailModule } from '@bg-hoard/store/feature-game-detail';`
   <br /><br />

5. **Run linting** against all the projects again.
   <br /><br />
6. You should see the expected error. Great! You can now **delete the import** above.
   <br /><br />
7. We also talked about the importance of setting boundaries between your workspace scopes.
   Let's try and **import a `store` lib** from an `api` scope. - In `apps/api/src/app/app.service.ts` - Try to `import { formatRating } from '@bg-hoard/store/util-formatters';`
   <br /><br />

8. **Run linting** on all projects - you should see another expected error.
   <br /><br />
9. You can now **delete the import** above.
   <br /><br />
10. **Run linting** again and check if all the errors went away.
   <br /><br />
11. **Commit everything** before moving on to the next lab
