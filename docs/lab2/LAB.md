# üíª Lab 2 - Generate an Angular app

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 15-20 minutes
<br />

In this lab we'll generate our first Angular application within the new monorepo.
<br /><br />

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- **Get familiar with generating new apps within your workspace using the Nx CLI**
<br /><br /><br />

## üì≤ After this workshop, your app should look similar to this:

</details>
<br />

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps:

1. Make sure you can run Nx commands:
   - try out `nx --version` and see if it outputs a version number
   - install the CLI globally: `npm i -g nx`
   - if you don't want to install it globally, use `yarn nx` instead of `nx` in all the commands below

> Please make sure you are using the latest version of Nx (14.5+)

   <br />

2. **Run `nx list`** to see which plugins you have installed and which are available
   <br /> <br /> 

3. **Add the Angular plugin: `yarn add @nrwl/angular`**
   <br /> <br /> 

4. Let's also **add Angular Material** so we can use some of their components: `yarn add @angular/material @angular/cdk`
   <br /> <br /> 
5. **Use the [`@nrwl/angular` plugin](https://nx.dev/packages/angular/generators/application) to generate an Angular app** called `store` in your new workspace

   ‚ö†Ô∏è**Important:** Make sure you **enable routing** when asked!

6. **Create a new `index.ts` file in the folder `apps/store/src/fake-api`** in your app, it returns an array of some games (you can copy the code from [here](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/fake-api/index.ts))
   
   ‚è≥**Reminder:** When you are given example files to copy, the folder they're in hints to the _folder_ and _filename_ you can place them in when you do the copying.
   <br /> <br /> 
   
7. **Add some basic styling to your new component** and display the games from the Fake API (to not spend too much time on this, you can copy it from here [.html](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/app/app.component.html) / [.css](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/app/app.component.css) / [.ts](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/app/app.component.ts) - and replace the full contents of the files)
   + You can get the example game images from [here](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/assets)
      <br />‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you put them in the correct folder
   <br /> <br /> 

9. **Add the Material Card Module to `app.module.ts`**:

   ```ts
   import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';
   ```
   Don't forget to add it to the imports section as well. 
   <br /> <br /> 
   
10. **Serve the app**: `nx serve store`
   <br /> <br /> 

11. **See your app** live at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

   ‚ö†Ô∏è In a company context you might need to define a hostname ``` nx serve store --host=my.host.name  ```
   <br /> <br /> 

12. **Inspect what changed** from the last time you committed, then **commit your changes**
   <br /> <br />

Your app should look similar to the screenshot above!

Now we're starting to see some content! But there are some styles missing: the Angular Material theme! We'll look at how to add it in the next workshop!

The ratings also don't look that good - we'll fix those in **Lab 5**.
