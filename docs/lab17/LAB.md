# üîç Lab 17 - NxCloud GitHub bot

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 10 minutes
<br />

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- **Explore the NxCloud Run-Detail pages**
- **Configure the NxCloud bot to get easy to read reports on the Nx checks performed during CI**
<br /><br /><br />

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

1. **Enable the NxCloud GitHub bot** on your GitHub repository: [https://github.com/apps/nx-cloud](https://github.com/apps/nx-cloud)
   <br /> <br />
2. Switch to a new branch: `git checkout -b nxcloud-bot`
   <br /> <br />
3. Add these env variables to your GitHub actions config:

    ```
    name: Run CI checks
    
    on: [pull_request]
    
    env:
      NX_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.number }}
      NX_RUN_GROUP: ${{ github.run_id }}
    
    jobs:
      build:
        ......
    ```
    <br /> <br />

4. Make a change in the store: `apps/store/src/app/app.component.ts` (so that it will trigger our affected commands in CI):

    ```
    export class AppComponent {
      constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
        console.log("component constructed")
      }
    ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è If you already added the `ci.yml` as an implicit dependency of `*`, this step is **optional**
   <br /> <br />

5. Commit everything and push your branch
   <br /> <br />
6. Make a PR on GitHub
   <br /> <br />
7. Once the checks finish you should see something similar to this:

    ![NxCloud Bot](./nx_cloud_bot.png)
    <br />
    
8. Click on one of the "failed" commands (if any). On the "Run Details" page, click on one of the projects and inspect the terminal output:

    ![Nx Cloud project](./nx-cloud-projects.png)
    
    üî• Rather than reading through CI logs, you can use this view to filter to the failed projects and inspect the failure reason scoped to that project.

    <br /> <br />
    
9. Have a look at the "Cache Hit" and "Cache Miss" filters. What do you think they do?

    ![Cache hit/miss](./cache_hit_miss.png)
    <br />
    
10. Finally, you should see a "Claim workspace" button at the top - it's a good idea to do that at this stage. We'll explain more about that in a bit!
   <br /> <br />

11. Merge your PR into master and pull latest locally:

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```
    <br />
