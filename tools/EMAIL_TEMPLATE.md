Hi to everyone at {{ company/ conference }}!

{{ co-speaker name }} and I are very excited to be able to have some time with you in the upcoming two days!

Here is a link to the repo we'll be using for the workshop: https://github.com/nrwl/nx-workshop

This repo includes the lab instructions as well as code snippets we'll be using in the workshop. The repo also includes branches that can be used to `jump ahead` to the start of another lab when necessary. Please take the opportunity to check this repo and ensure that the prerequisites are satisfied (excerpt below for your convenience!

If you look at very bottom of the README.md you will notice there are two tracks branching on the end of the second day:
- React frontends and more custom generators practice
- Fly.io API deployments

Please let us know which track you would like us to take. You can also decide this tomorrow after day one.

Looking forward to meeting you all!
